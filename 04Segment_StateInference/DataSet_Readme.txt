To train the model, it needs to copy the files(segmentBaseTrainCsi.mat, segmentBaseTrainLab.mat, segmentTestCsi.mat and segmentTestLab.mat) generated by 02Segment_ExtractTrainData\TrainingDataForSegment into data\.

2test_8_parameterPredictSeg_scaler_only6.bat is for inferring the state labels of CSI bins. To this end, it needs to copy the folder(Data_DiscretizeCsi) generated by 03Segment_DiscretizeCsi into here.
